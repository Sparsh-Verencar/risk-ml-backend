FILE PATHS:
replace the file paths accordingly in the code depending on the drive. for example, for D drive use above. 

FOR JYUPTER:
To use Jyupter VSCODE, download microsoft extension for Jyupter from extension section. You can tweak the values with sliders and see real time graph.

FOR TRAINING:
exclude_cols = ['Delay_Days', 'Disruption_Type', 'Disruption_Severity'] . the columns removed from csv. 
Also check the csv file path incase loading issue. 

FOR TESTING:
You may use modeltest or otherstest  . Others test was made for testing changing code. 

Importances:
Importances can be checked from importances.py.

**you may ignore transformlearnt, it was for testing yeo jhonson transform which is discarded nnow

Skewness for the Dataset:
can be checked from skewnesscheck.py . shows the dataset skewness (includes delivery and disruption)
